- Java: Remove ISocket interface (due to wrong design).
- Java: Remodeled IAsyncScheduler interface (for allow other implementations).
- Java: Add EPoll and EPollScheduler implementation for async sockets in linux.

- Clojure: Adapt internals to java api changes.
- Clojure: Start working through abstractions (everything defined as protocol)
- Clojure: Use reify instead usless defrecords.
